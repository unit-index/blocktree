# Blocktree

Blocktree is a tree-based blockchain designed for interstellar decentralized applications (DApps), AI-driven decentralized finance (DeFi), and edge computing. Unlike traditional linear blockchains, Blocktree uses a dynamically growing tree architecture with periodic branch splits guided by spectral clustering (Fiedler vector of a latency-based Laplacian matrix). It features subsecond block times, Proof of Work (PoW) consensus, and a unified cryptocurrency, Blocktree Coin (BKT). Blocktree aims to power scalable, permissionless networks for Martian commerce, autonomous AI economies, and IoT networks.

This project is an open-source initiative, inviting developers to contribute to a decentralized future spanning Earth and beyond. See our [white paper](https://blocktree.com/whitepaper) for details.

## Features
- **Tree Architecture**: Scales via isolated branches, split using latency-aware clustering.
- **Proof of Work**: Permissionless mining with subsecond block times (~0.2s).
- **Spectral Clustering**: Fiedler vector-based node partitioning for efficient splits.
- **Blocktree Coin (BKT)**: Unified cryptocurrency with exponential reward decay.
- **Modular Design**: Extensible for P2P networking, interstellar transactions, and DApps.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Rust 1.75+ (install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/))
- Git

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/blocktree.git
   cd blocktree
   ```
2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```
3. Run the prototype:
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```
4. Run tests:
   ```bash
   cargo test
   ```

### Usage
The prototype simulates a single-node Blocktree with:
- A genesis block in the `root` branch.
- Periodic branch splits after 5 blocks.
- Transaction support with Merkle roots.
- Mock P2P networking and in-memory storage.

See `src/main.rs` for example usage.
